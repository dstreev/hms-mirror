# JDBC Drivers and Configuration

`hms-mirror` requires JDBC drivers to connect to the various end-points needed to perform it's tasks.  The `LEFT` and `RIGHT` cluster endpoints for HiveServer2 require the standalone JDBC drivers that are specific to that Hive version.

`hms-mirror` supports the Apache and packaged hive **standalone** drivers that are found with your distribution.  For CDP, we also support to Cloudera JDBC driver found and maintained at on the [Cloudera Hive JDBC Downloads Page](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/hive/jdbc).  Note that the URL configurations between the Apache and Cloudera JDBC drivers are different.

When using the Cloudera JDBC driver, you'll need to add the property `driverClassName: "com.cloudera.hive.jdbc.HS2Driver"` to the `hiveServer2` configuration. If you're NOT using the Cloudera JDBC driver, just remove the property.

Starting with the Apache Standalone driver shipped with CDP 7.1.8 cummulative hot fix parcels, you will need to include additional jars in the configuration `jarFile` configuration, due to some packaging adjustments.

For example: `jarFile: "<cdp_parcel_jars>/hive-jdbc-3.1.3000.7.1.8.28-1-standalone.jar:<cdp_parcel_jars>/log4j-1.2-api-2.18.0.jar:<cdp_parcel_jars>/log4j-api-2.18.0.jar:<cdp_parcel_jars>/log4j-core-2.18.0.jar"` NOTE: The jar file with the Hive Driver MUST be the first in the list of jar files.

The Cloudera JDBC driver shouldn't require additional jars.
