# Options

Use `-ep|--export-partition-count <limit>` to set the limit for the number of partitions to use EXPORT_IMPORT.  The default is 100.  When a table has a partition count that exceeds this value, the [SQL](SQL.md) strategy will be used.
 
## `-sp,--sql-partition-count <limit>` 

Sets the limit for the number of partitions that the [SQL](SQL.md) strategy will process.  If the value is exceeded, the process will NOT migrate the table.  The default is 500 .

To persist a higher value without specifying the `-sp` option, add the following to the [config](hms-mirror-Default-Configuration-Template.md).

```yaml
hybrid:
  sqlPartitionLimit: <limit>
```

## `-ma|--migrate-acid` or `-mao|--migrate-acid-only`

Include ACID tables in processing.

## `-da|--downgrade-acid`

Applicable only when `-ma|o` is used.  This will take the ACID tables and downgrade them to *EXTERNAL/PURGE* tables.  [Buckets adjustments](hms-mirror-features.md#acid-tables) are applicable.

## `-dc|--distcp`

For EXTERNAL tables, this will build a `distcp` plan that can be used to transfer the database tables.

When the option `-ma|o` is used, ACID tables will be migrated. *ACID* tables will be converted to EXTERNAL transfer tables for the `distcp` operations.  On the other cluster, the tables will be created initially as *EXTERNAL*, then transferred back over to *ACID* tables, unless `-da` is used.

If the `-da` is used the tables will remain *EXTERNAL* on the new cluster.

When `-is` is used, there will be `distcp` operations required on both clusters to handle data movement to/from the `intermediate-storage` area.

## `-is|--intermediate-storage` or `-cs|--common-storage`

When the clusters aren't [linked](Linking-Cluster-Storage-Layers.md) these two options provide a way to transfer data through an intermediate/common storage location.  Each cluster must have access to these locations.  These values are mutually exclusive.

`--intermediate-storage` requires an addition transfer of data.  The LEFT transfers data to the `-is` location and the RIGHT cluster uses that data and initiates a transfer from the location to the final hcfsNamespace value set for the cluster. This is a two copy migration.

`--common-storage` assumes the location is also the final resting place for the data.  Some optimizations are possible (ACID downgrades) that reduce that times data need to move. This is a single copy migration.

## `-wd|--warehouse-directory` and `-ewd|--external-warehouse-directory`

Are used to set the *databases* default locations for managed and external tables.  This overrides the systems *hive metastore* properties.

## `-rdl|--reset-to-default-location`

Regardless of where the source data _relative_ location was on the filesystem, this will reset it to the default location on the new cluster.

If `-dc|--distcp` is used, then the `warehouse` options are required in order for `hms-mirror` to build the `distcp` workplan.
