# Runtime Interfaces

The classic 'hms-mirror' interface is the command line interface (CLI).  This is the interface that most users have used in the past.  Support for this is still provided but is quickly being replaced by the Web interface.

The CLI interface requires users to define a configuration file that the is used to control connection endpoints, and cluster attributes.  Runtime operations are controlled by command line options that are passed to the application.

The Web interface provides a much more complete experience for users and allows configurations to be built and validated in a more interactive way.  The Web interface is the preferred interface for users who are new to the application and we encourage existing users to adopt this interface as well since it's capabilities and usability a vast improvement over the CLI.
