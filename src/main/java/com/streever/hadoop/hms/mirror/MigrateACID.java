    When migrating ACID tables, older ACID tables (Hive 1/2) required buckets in the definition.  In Hive 3, this is no longer
    required.  The option provides a means to rewrite the definition so that buckets don't need to be a part of the definition.
    This is helpful when the bucket definition was required but not a part of design and lead to an artificial design element.

    The default of 2 means that any definition we find which 2 buckets or less will be removed to NO bucket strategy in the new
    definition.


    Set this value to -1 to eliminate this check and translate the bucket definitions as they are.

    Migrating ACID tables through a transfer table is the only way to convert ACIDv1 tables to ACIDv2.  The EXPORT_IMPORT
    process between Hive 1/2 isn't compatible with Hive 3.  So this process will create a staging table for the transfer.
    If there are too many partitions the process of transferring data from the source to the transfer table AND later, the
    final ACID table, can be problematic.  Mostly because of resources or limits on containers and AM and Task memory sizes.

    This value allow us to set a value that limits the size of the partitioned dataset we'll attempt to address.  When the
    number of partitions for the source table exceeds this value, we won't even try to attempt this.
